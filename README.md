# Jelastic MySQL Database Replication Installation Package 

This repository provides [MySQL Database Replication](http://docs.jelastic.com/database-master-slave-replication/) JPS-based installation package for Jelastic Platform.


**MySQL Database Replication** is used to solve performance problems, to support the db backups, and to alleviate system failures. It enables data from one database server (master) to be replicated to another (slave).

**Engine**: java7

**Environment topology**:

1. 
   - node type: mysql5
   - count: 2
   - cloudlets: 16
   - external IP: none

### What it can be used for?
MySQL/MariaDB Database Master-Slave Replication is used to solve a number of different problems with performance, supporting the backup of different databases, and as a part of a larger solution to alleviate system failures.<br />
It enables data from one database server (the master) to be replicated to one or more database servers (the slaves). The master logs the updates, which then ripple through to the slaves. The slave outputs a message stating that it has received the update successfully, thus allowing to send the subsequent updates. Master-slave replication can be either synchronous or asynchronous. The difference is simply the timing of propagation of changes. If the changes are made to the master and slave at the same time, it is synchronous. If changes are queued up and written later, it is asynchronous.<br />
<br />
The target usage for replication in MariaDB and MySQL databases includes:
  -  Scale-out solutions
  -  Data security
  -  Analytics
  -  Long-distance data distribution

### What Jelastic JPS package is?

Jelastic JPS package represents an one-click installation solution, that allows to get the desired project hosted at Jelastic Cloud in a matter of minutes. Being based on [Jelastic Packaging Standard](https://docs.jelastic.com/jps), it automates creation of the necessary environment and subsequent application deployment to it. Herewith, all of the required properties and behaviors are predefined within the package JSON manifest, so you instantly get the ready-to-go solution.
The full list of the available at a platform one-click packages can be seen at the corresponding same-named section of [Jelastic Marketplace](https://docs.jelastic.com/marketplace#apps].
